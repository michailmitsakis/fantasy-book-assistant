# 📚 Fantasy & Sci-Fi Book Assistant

### 🧩 Overview
Ever wanted to quickly sort through the vast number of fantasy and science fiction books to find the next best thing? This project is a lightweight fantasy & sci-fi book assistant that helps users explore and query a curated collection of best-selling fantasy & science fiction books. Users can ask natural-language questions about books (themes, tone, pacing, etc.) and receive concise, context-aware answers based on the indexed book metadata.

## 📘 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains detailed metadata about popular **fantasy and science-fiction books**, including:

- **Book Name:** The title of the book (e.g., *The Way of Kings*, *Dune*, *The Left Hand of Darkness*).  
- **Author Name:** The author or co-authors of the book (e.g., Brandon Sanderson, Ursula K. Le Guin).  
- **Series Name & Position:** The book series and its order within that series (e.g., *The Stormlight Archive – Book 1*).  
- **Subgenres:** The literary subcategories (e.g., Epic Fantasy, Space Opera, Dystopian).  
- **Themes:** The major narrative ideas or motifs (e.g., Revolution, Friendship, Colonization, Artificial Intelligence).  
- **Publisher:** The publishing house that released the book.  
- **Publication Year:** The year the book was first published.  
- **Page Count:** The approximate length of the book.  
- **Pacing / Tone / Writing Style:** Qualitative descriptors of how the story unfolds and feels (e.g., Fast-paced, Hopeful, Lyrical).  
- **Target Audience:** The intended readership (e.g., Adult, Young Adult, Middle Grade).  
- **Setting Type:** The main narrative environment (e.g., Interstellar, Medieval-inspired, Post-apocalyptic).  
- **Technology Focus:** The presence or role of technology (e.g., Space travel, AI).  
- **Awards:** Recognitions the book has received (e.g., Hugo Award, Nebula Award, Locus Award).  
- **Content Warnings:** Mentions of sensitive or potentially triggering topics.  
- **Summary:** A short description of the book’s premise and main plot elements.

The dataset was **generated and cleaned both manually and using ChatGPT**, combining structured metadata collection and light manual curation.  
It contains **almost 200 entries** and serves as the **foundation for the Book Assistant’s recommendations, retrieval, and contextual reasoning**.

You can find the data file in [`data/data.json`](data/data.json).

## 🧰 Installation

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fantasy-book-assistant.git
cd fantasy-book-assistant
```

### 2️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# or
source .venv/bin/activate         # macOS/Linux
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run Qdrant in Docker
```bash
docker run -p 6333:6333 -d qdrant/qdrant
```

### 5️⃣ Start Ollama locally
Download [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/download), then pull a model:
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2
```

---

## 🧠 How to Run the App

### ▶️ Step 1: Index your data (optional)
`rag.py` automatically creates and fills the `books-rag` Qdrant collection from `data/data.json`.  
You can also trigger indexing manually:
```bash
python ingest.py
```

### ▶️ Step 2: Launch the Streamlit app (make sure both the Qdrant image in Docker and Ollama are running)
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### ▶️ Step 3: Open the browser
Go to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)

## 💡 Usage
1. Type a natural-language question such as  
   > “Great modern epic fantasy with complex worldbuilding?”
2. Optionally set filters for **author**, **year**, or **page count**.  
3. Click **Ask** to generate an answer.  
4. View the model’s answer and explore the retrieved book entries via expandable “Sources”.

## 📊 Evaluation — *LLM-as-a-Judge Results*

The RAG pipeline was evaluated using an **LLM as a judge** to classify generated answers as:

- **RELEVANT**  
- **PARTLY_RELEVANT**  
- **NON_RELEVANT**

Across the evaluated dataset, results were:

| Category          | Percentage |
|--------------------|-------------|
| ✅ RELEVANT         | **12%** |
| ⚖️ PARTLY_RELEVANT  | **37%** |
| ❌ NON_RELEVANT     | **51%** |

🔹 These results indicate that while the pipeline retrieves good contextual matches, the local small llama3.2 LLM (running on limited context) tends to be **strict** in relevance scoring — marking even partially correct answers as non-relevant when missing minor details. Nonetheless, the final responses to user queries seem mostly relevant according to heuristic experiments.

Future improvements could involve:
- Reranking or hybrid retrieval (text + metadata)  
- Using a larger or fine-tuned judge model  
- Prompt tuning for better factual grounding
